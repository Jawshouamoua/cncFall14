Programming language homework #6
Joshua Kendall

5.1

for C, the basic types are short, int, long, float, double, and char.
int: 32 bits
long: 64 bits
float: 32 bits
double: 64 bits
char: 8 bits

5.2
In haskell, Bool is ordered but it is not convertible to a integer.
In some languages, it might be useful to have bools convert to ints,
but for haskell, I don't think this is necessary or helpful because
haskell has a strict typing system and this could cause problems with
the overall functionality of haskell.

5.3

This is useful because it seems like it's a safety feature so that
non-bool types can't be used to logical tests. This is so that a java
program can't do something it's not supposed to.

union thirtyTwoBit {
	int i;
	int r ;
	String bit ;

	for(int j=0; j<32; j++) {
		if(i >= 2**j) {
			i =	i - 2**j ;
			bit += "1" ;	
		else
			bit += "0" ;
	}
}

5.9
Big-endianess stores the most significant byte of a work in the smallest
address. An example is the IBM z/Architecture.

Little-endianess stores the least significant bit of a word in the smallest
address. An example is the Intel x86 machine.


5.14

The assignment of a and b throws an error because it could be referring to
the address of the array instead of the array itself. This could be fixed
with &a = &b.
