4.1
a)
Haskell has no variable declarations. It infers the type based on the code.
b)
There are no overloading of operators in Python, but functions can be
overloaded.
c)
Python's closures are late binding meaning that the values of variables
used in closures are looked up at the time the inner functions is called.
d)
Tabs constitute scope for Python.
e)
no declarations

 

4.2
a)
They can be accessed using the declaration "extern".
b)
Structs hide data from other modules.
c)
So other units can't change the global variable.

4.3

C++ has more delcarations than c, like asm, new, this, etc..
 
4.5
a)
The identifier is the same, so just the type is not enough to create a 
unqiue variable.
b)
Overloaded functions redefines the function rather than redeclares it.

4.6
examples of l-values are identifiers of integral, floating, pointer,
structure, or union type; a subscript expression that doesn't evaluate
to an array; a member-selection expression (-> or .); or a unary-
indirection expression that doesn't refer to an array. All l-values can
be r-values, but not r-values can be l-values.
