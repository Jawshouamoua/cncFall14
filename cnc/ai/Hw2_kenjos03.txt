If performance is only measured for a certain number of timesteps
n, then once the the agent reaches time n, then there isn't a 
goal for the agent to fulfill.

a)
True, DFS always expands to the deepest node first and works back
from there. An A* will calculate a modest guess which will never
actually reach the the bottom of the search space, so the DFS will
always be at least as big as A*.

b)
True, heuristic functions have one constraint and that is if n
is a goal node, then h(n) = 0.

c)
Maybe true? A* seems like it requires too many resources to be 
applied to real-world, complex problem.

d)
True, if no cost steps are allowed, there is still the current
node so it is still complete.

e)
True, Manhattan distance deals with horizontal and vertical 
measuring, which mimics how the rook moves.
