The specularities of the handle are reflectance, the carrot in front of the pot is depth,
the "light" line down the middle of the kettle is surface orientation, the handle of the pot is illumination,
the vegetables in the pot are depth, etc.

a)
d = 2 * (512 px/10 cm) * 16 cm * (0.5 m/Z)

if Z is 16 m, then the total disparity is 51.2 pixels or 51 pixels.

b)
Z = 2 * (512 px/10 cm) * 16 cm * (0.5 m/d)
if d = 51, then Z = 16.06 meters.
if d = 52, then Z = 15.75 meters.

Difference is .31 meters or 31 cm.

c)
A disparity of 1 px would be a 51.2 cm, so if we swapped d and Z in the
original formula, we would get a disparity of 1 px.

a)
False

b)
True

c)
False

d)
False

The distance can be measured for points A, B, and C, because both
cameras can see those points. However, for the points D and E, only
one camera can see those each, so they cameras will not be able to
determine the distances of those points.
